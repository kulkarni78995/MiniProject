# **RISK-BASED ANALYSIS USING STATIC AND DYNAMIC IDENTIFIERS**

##  1.ABSTRACT
When there are large gatherings and conferences, there is always additional threat from unknown 
sources that often go undetected through traditional systems. Failing to do so results wide range of negative outcomes including impact to your group’s reputation a potential lawsuit. With large 
event, the potential for risk often grows with the number of people in attendance. Unfortunately, 
people can be unpredictable. Being able to recognize security threats, particularly on a level that is proportionate to the size of the event and in a way that suits the various event details, is crucial for ensuring the safety of all guests.

## 2.INTRODUCTION
This technology is capable of identifying objects that exist in images and videos and tracking them. Object Recognition also known as Object Detection, has various applications like face recognition, body movement pattern analysis, and lot moreConsidering large gatherings or events it’s difficult to secure the environment by checking each and every person.

So using Artificial intelligence and machine learning the crowd can be continuously monitored with the help of pre-defined data and real-time object detection.Using this data any kind of undesirable movement or hazardous equipment can be easily detected.

One of the significant applications of object recognition is in crowd monitoring and management, especially in large gatherings or events where it is difficult to secure the environment by checkingeach and every person. With the help of pre-defined data and real-time object detection, AI-powered systems can continuously monitor crowds, detecting any kind of undesirable movement or hazardous equipment.

The benefits of object recognition in crowd management are immense, as it helps identify and 
prevent potential threats or hazards before they occur. For instance, detecting a person carrying a weapon or suspicious equipment in a crowd can alert security personnel in real-time, allowing them to take swift action to prevent any untoward incidents.

## 3.LITERATURE SURVEY
**(Bate et al., 2022)** proposed that adults with prosopagnosia who underwent 8 weeks of face recognition training showed significant improvements in their ability to recognize faces, even when the faces were presented in challenging conditions, such as with occlusion or from unusual angles.

**(Lee & Hwang, 2022)** proposed performance of object detection is determined by the structure of the neural network used, the training data, and the optimal weight selected in the learning process. If an appli-cation uses YOLO as an object detection model and wants to recognize general objects, it has the advantage of being able to use the weights already learned and provided in YOLO as it is.

**(Haritha et al., 2022)** explained that the YOLO algorithm works by dividing an image into a grid of cells. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects of a particular class. The YOLO algorithm then predicts the bounding boxes and confidence scores for each object class in each cell. The bounding box is a rectangle that encloses the object, and the confidence score is a measure of how likely it is that the object is present in the cell.

**(Fang Liu et al., 2022)** discussed the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and its recent version, YOLOv8, which is known for its real-time processing speed and accuracy. The authors provide an overview of the YOLOv8 architecture, which includes a backbone network for feature extraction, detection heads for object detection, and anchor-based bounding box regression for localization. They also discuss the challenges of training YOLOv8, including a large number of anchor boxes and the imbalance between object and background samples,2022

**(Wang & Deng, 2021)** have examined that provides an overview of deep face recognition techniques. It discusses the historical development, key components, various approaches, challenges, and future directions in the field of face recognition, specifically focusing on deep learning-based methods. Published in the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence in 2021, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in face recognition using deep learning techniques,2021.

**(Zeng et al., 2021)** Face recognition is a challenging task due to the variability of human faces, such as pose, expression, illumination, and occlusion. Deep learning has shown great promise in face recognition, but it is still sensitive to image quality. Image processing techniques can be used to improve the quality of face images, which can lead to improved performance of deep face recognition systems.

**(Liu et al., 2020)** Challenges in detection accuracy stem from (1) the vast range of intra-class variations and (2) the huge number of object categories. Intra-class variations can be divided into two types: intrinsic factors and imaging conditions. In terms of intrinsic factors, each object category can have many different object instances, possibly varying in one or more of colour, textures, materials, shapes, and size, such as the “chair” category. Even in a more narrowly defined class, such as human or horse, object instances can appear in different poses, subject to nonrigid deformations or with the addition of clothing.

**(Taskiran et al., 2020)** have explained the delves into the details of various face recognition algorithms and methodologies and discusses the key components and steps involved in face recognition systems, including face detection, feature extraction, and classification. Also an overview of different feature extraction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP), explaining their strengths, limitations, and application areas,2020.

**(Int. Res. J. Eng. Techno, 2020)** have proposed works on object detection, including traditional methods such as R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN, as well as other deep learning-based approaches such as SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) and RetinaNet. They highlight the advantages of YOLO over these methods, such as its real-time processing speed, ability to detect objects of varying scales and aspect ratios, and the lack of the need for region proposal networks,2020.

## 4.METHODOLOGY
The proposed solution should use some form of analytics to be able to profile the individuals within a video stream. There are multiple ways to mitigate the risk. Some of them are discussed below

### _Using a pre-defined watch list_
There are pre-determined datasets of individuals who pose a certain level of threat in certain events and with correct context, those can be identified. Video surveillance with intelligent data analytics can identify Persons of Interest (POIs) in real-time with live facial recognition, enabling your security team to rapidly respond to threats while protecting the privacy of bystanders.

### _Facial Recognition_
Facial recognition is a technology that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and verify a person's identity based on their facial features. It works by analyzing various unique features of a person's face, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the jawline. These features are then compared to a database of known faces to determine the identity of the person. Facial recognition technology has a wide range of applications, including security systems, access control, and identification verification. However, it has also raised concerns around privacy and data protection, as the technology can potentially be used for mass surveillance and tracking.

### _Object Recognition_
Identifying unidentified or unrequired objects that people carry in a place of concern. On positive recognition, there should be a notification system in place to alert the authorities and automatically update the risk profile of the person of interest. You are free to use any existing algorithms for object recognition.
